The goal of this project is to create a minimalist template (initial scaffolding or skeleton), similar to the seed app project, but with the following differences:

1. uses the version of AngularJS;
2. uses `yarn` instead of `bower`.

This project was inspired by [AngularJS with Gulp Step by Step](https://youtu.be/p9ZngMW80-k).
